# EasyPanel template

This directory contains an EasyPanel template for Vault. It follows the
format used by the official EasyPanel templates repository:

- `meta.yaml` describes the template metadata and input schema.
- `index.ts` generates the EasyPanel services.

The template deploys two services:

- Vault, exposed on port `8502`.
- SurrealDB v2, kept private on the project network and persisted in a volume.

## Testing

1. Copy this directory to `templates/vault` in
   `easypanel-io/templates`.
2. Run the EasyPanel templates playground with `npm run dev`.
3. Create the template from the generated JSON inside an EasyPanel instance.

Set an Vault password in the form before deploying. If it is left blank,
the template generates one and stores it in the app service environment as
`VAULT_PASSWORD`.

After deployment, open the EasyPanel domain and configure AI providers from
Vault's Settings > API Keys page.
