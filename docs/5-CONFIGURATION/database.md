# Database - SurrealDB Configuration

Vault uses SurrealDB for its database needs. 

---

## Default Configuration

Vault should work out of the box with SurrealDB as long as the environment variables are correctly setup. 


### DB running in the same docker compose as Vault (recommended)

The example above is for when you are running SurrealDB as a separate docker container, which is the method described [here](../1-INSTALLATION/docker-compose.md) (and our recommended method). 

```env
SURREAL_URL="ws://surrealdb:8000/rpc"
SURREAL_USER="root"
SURREAL_PASSWORD="root"
SURREAL_NAMESPACE="vault_core"
SURREAL_DATABASE="vault_core"
```

### DB running in the host machine and Vault running in Docker

If ON is running in docker and SurrealDB is on your host machine, you need to point to it. 

```env
SURREAL_URL="ws://your-machine-ip:8000/rpc" #or host.docker.internal
SURREAL_USER="root"
SURREAL_PASSWORD="root"
SURREAL_NAMESPACE="vault_core"
SURREAL_DATABASE="vault_core"
```

### Vault and Surreal are running on the same machine

If you are running both services locally or if you are using the deprecated [single container setup](../1-INSTALLATION/single-container.md)

```env
SURREAL_URL="ws://localhost:8000/rpc"
SURREAL_USER="root"
SURREAL_PASSWORD="root"
SURREAL_NAMESPACE="vault_core"
SURREAL_DATABASE="vault_core"
```

## Multiple databases

You can have multiple namespaces in one SurrealDB instance and you can also have multiple databases in one instance. So, if you want to setup multiple open noteobok deployments for different users, you don't need to deploy multiple databases.
