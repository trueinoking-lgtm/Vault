# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documented the flow-driven release process in `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`, including the `ready` to `main` to stable release path, dev/stable image labels, and maintainer verification checklist (#938)
- List view for the Notebooks page — a tile/list toggle in the header lets you switch between the visual card grid and a compact row layout (name, description, source/note counts, last updated) for easier scanning of large collections. The choice is remembered across reloads and translated across all 14 locales (#885)
- Documented the `ESPERANTO_TTS_TIMEOUT` environment variable (default `300`s) in the environment reference; raise it for slow or self-hosted TTS providers so long podcast segments don't fail with a timeout (#937)
- `SECURITY.md` with a coordinated-disclosure policy: how to privately report a vulnerability via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting, supported versions, and response expectations (#943)
- LaTeX math rendering (KaTeX) now also applies to source content, source insights, Ask answers, transformation output, and the note editor preview — previously only chat had it (#269)
- "Refresh content" action on web-link sources — re-fetches the URL and re-embeds the source so its content stays current, available from the source card menu once processing has completed (translated across all 14 locales) (#259)

### Changed
- `docker-compose.yml` now sources the SurrealDB credentials from `SURREAL_USER` / `SURREAL_PASSWORD` (applied to both the database server and the app), defaulting to `root:root` so the zero-config quick start is unchanged. Set them in a `.env` file to use your own credentials before exposing the instance; `.env.example` and the compose file note this (#946)

### Fixed
- API no longer freezes for all requests while a chat waits on the LLM. Both the notebook chat (`execute_chat`) and source chat handlers ran LangGraph's synchronous `invoke()` directly on the event loop; they now run it via `asyncio.to_thread()` (matching the existing `get_state` calls), so other requests stay responsive — and the source-chat SSE can flush its early events instead of stalling until the model finishes (#704)
- Windows native install guide no longer points users at a `start-vault.bat` that doesn't exist in the repo; the Quick Start now documents starting the four services manually with `uv run`, plus an optional sample launcher you can save yourself (#846)
- OpenRouter (and other providers') "Discover models" dialog no longer cuts off the submit button: the dialog now uses a fixed header/footer with a scrollable body (`grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]`) instead of scrolling the whole content, so the "Add" button stays visible regardless of how many models are listed (#816)
- Chat references using the short `[insight:<id>]` form (emitted by some models) are now rendered as clickable citations like `[source_insight:<id>]` and `[note:<id>]` already were; `insight` is treated as an alias for `source_insight`, so clicking it opens the insight (#490)
- CRUD endpoints now return `404` (not `500`) for a non-existent resource. `ObjectModel.get()` raises `NotFoundError` rather than returning a falsy value, so the broad `except Exception` in each handler was masking it as a server error. Added an explicit `NotFoundError → 404` arm to the notebook (update / delete / delete-preview / add-source / remove-source), note (get / update / delete / list / create), model (delete), credential (update / delete) and embed handlers (#862)
- Token counting no longer raises `ValueError: disallowed special token '<|endoftext|>'` when source/context content contains special-token sequences; `token_count()` now encodes with `disallowed_special=()` so such substrings are treated as ordinary text (#667)
- Single-container image no longer hangs at "API not ready yet" on a brand-new instance. `supervisord.single.conf` ran the API and worker with `uv run` (without `--no-sync`), so at startup `uv` tried to sync dev dependencies it couldn't resolve against the `--no-dev` build. Both processes now use `uv run --no-sync`, matching the multi-container `supervisord.conf` (#609)
- Note editor now expands to fill the dialog instead of being capped at `500px`; removed the `max-h-[500px]` constraint that overrode the `flex-1` parent and cramped editing on tall windows (#932)

### Security
- Resolved dependency audit findings: added npm `overrides` for vulnerable transitive frontend packages (`ws`, `brace-expansion`, `ajv`, `@eslint/plugin-kit`, `postcss`) — `npm audit` now reports 0 vulnerabilities — refreshed `uv.lock` (`langsmith`, `pydantic-settings`, `pip`), and hardened external `window.open(..., '_blank')` calls with `noopener,noreferrer` (#962)

## [1.10.0] - 2026-06-17

### Security
- Bumped **Starlette to 1.2.1** and **FastAPI to 0.136.3** to address **CVE-2026-48710** ("BadHost"), a denial-of-service in Starlette's host header handling (#859)

### Added
- LaTeX math rendering in chat — inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) expressions are now rendered with KaTeX (#606)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable to configure the frontend API request timeout (default `600000` = 10 minutes; set `0` to disable). Lets slow/long-running chat models finish without editing source (#880)
- Bulk chat-context actions in a notebook, via a "Context" menu in the Sources and Notes column headers — translated across all 14 locales (#223):
  - Sources: "Include all (insights only)" (sources without insights are left out rather than forced to full), "Include all (full content)", and "Exclude all from context"
  - Notes: "Include all in context" / "Exclude all from context"
- **Turkish (tr-TR) localization** — the UI is now fully translated into Turkish (#871)

### Changed
- Failed source cards now show a prominent "Retry processing" button directly on the card instead of only inside the 3-dot dropdown; clicking it no longer also opens the source (the click was missing `stopPropagation`) (#726)
- Docker base image updated to **Debian trixie** and **Node.js 22.x** (#914)

### Fixed
- Podcast generation now uses the notebook's real content. `Notebook.get_context()` was missing, so generation ran against empty context; it now assembles source and note content as expected (#864)
- `PUT` profile handlers now use `model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`, so partial updates no longer overwrite unspecified fields with defaults (#860)
- OpenRouter embedding models are now correctly recognized via their embedding modality (#842)
- Search and Ask results now use page-level scrolling instead of being confined to a cramped, height-capped (`60vh`) bottom container, so the full result set is readable (#882)
- `POST /sources/{id}/retry` no longer returns `400 "Source is not associated with any notebooks"` for every source; it now queries the `reference` graph edge by its `in`/`out` columns instead of a non-existent `source` column (#861)
- `POST /sources/{id}/retry` no longer returns a `500` ("too many values to unpack") after successfully queuing the retry job; the command ID was being double-prefixed (`command:command:…`) before being saved to the source. Retrying a failed source now succeeds and updates the source's command reference
- `GET /sources/{id}` for a missing or deleted source now returns `404` instead of `500`; the handler caught `NotFoundError` in its generic `except` and mapped it to a server error
- Sources that fail to ingest (e.g. an unreachable or invalid URL) are now marked `failed` instead of silently saved as `completed` with the extraction error as their body. This means the "Retry processing" button (#726) actually appears for the most common failure mode; previously the job returned a failure payload but the command still completed, so the source never reached a retryable state (#726)
- Text search no longer returns a 500 when SurrealDB's `search::highlight` hits a "position overflow" on large or multi-byte document chunks; it now falls back to vector search and returns results (#648)
- `POST /api/search` now rejects a non-positive `limit` with a `422` instead of passing `LIMIT -1`/`LIMIT 0` to SurrealDB (which caused a 500 or a silently empty result set) (#863)
- Ollama `num_ctx` credential override is now persisted. The `credential` table gained a flexible `config` object (migration 15) and provider-specific tuning options are stored there instead of being dropped by the SCHEMAFULL table; future per-credential options can be added without a schema migration (#875)
- Worker no longer crashes on queued jobs from older versions; legacy embedding command aliases (`embed_single_item`, `embed_chunk`, `vectorize_source`) are registered and delegate to the current commands so stale queues drain cleanly (#695, #876)

### Performance
- Notebook source list no longer re-renders every `SourceCard` on unrelated state changes (layout toggles, context selection), and completed sources no longer each open a status-polling query. Both scaled with the number of sources and caused UI lag on large notebooks (#503)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added
- **New audio providers**, surfacing the capabilities added in Esperanto 2.21–2.22:
  - **Mistral Voxtral** speech-to-text (`voxtral-*-latest`) and text-to-speech (`voxtral-mini-tts`), reusing the existing Mistral credential (#827)
  - **Deepgram** text-to-speech (Aura voice catalog) as a new provider (`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`) (#827)
  - **xAI** text-to-speech (#827)
  - **Google** speech-to-text & text-to-speech, **Vertex** text-to-speech, and **ElevenLabs** speech-to-text (Scribe), completing the audio provider matrix (#828)
- Optional per-credential **`num_ctx`** (context window) override for Ollama models, configurable in Settings → API Keys and translated across all 13 locales (#825)
- `VAULT_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable to override the embedding batch size; default remains `50`. Helps with CPU-only local embedding and stricter OpenAI-compatible endpoints (#735)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable to configure the API's allowed origins (comma-separated). Default remains `*` for backward compatibility; the API now logs a startup warning prompting users to set it for production deployments. Exception responses honor the configured origins when explicitly set (#585, #597, #730)
- `VAULT_MIN_CHUNK_SIZE` environment variable (default: 5 tokens) to filter out degenerate tiny chunks before embedding. Set to `0` to disable.

### Changed
- Bumped **Esperanto 2.20.0 → 2.22.0**. Beyond the new audio providers above, this inherits several upstream fixes and behavior changes (see below).

### Inherited from Esperanto 2.21–2.22
- **Fixed:** OpenRouter LLM and embedding requests now send a proper JSON body (previously sent a malformed form-encoded payload).
- **Fixed:** OpenAI-compatible endpoints (e.g. llama.cpp) that return null embeddings now raise a clear, descriptive error instead of an opaque `TypeError`.
- **Fixed:** Streaming tool calls now return proper `ToolCall` objects across Anthropic, Google, Vertex, and Ollama.
- **Fixed:** `base_url` trailing slashes are normalized across providers, preventing double-slash URLs (and 301 redirects) for Ollama and other self-hosted endpoints.
- **Fixed:** Ollama "thinking" models (e.g. Qwen) now merge their reasoning content correctly.
- **Fixed:** Model discovery honors a custom `base_url` (LiteLLM/vLLM/OpenAI-compatible proxies).
- **Behavior change:** the Ollama default context window (`num_ctx`) is now **8192** (was 128000) to avoid out-of-memory errors on consumer GPUs. Raise it per-credential via the new `num_ctx` field if your hardware allows.
- **Behavior change:** the Google embedding default model is now `gemini-embedding-001` (the previous default, `text-embedding-004`, was removed from Google's API). If you used Google embeddings with the old default, re-create the model and re-embed your content (embedding dimensions changed).
- **Fixed:** Google TTS default model updated to a currently-working preview model.

### Fixed
- URL source embedding no longer crashes with `TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a real number, not 'NoneType'` when header-based splitters emit single-character fragments from complex HTML pages (e.g. Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg). Such chunks are now filtered before being sent to the embedding provider (#764)
- Language toggle now uses `t('common.german')` instead of a hardcoded "Deutsch" label, matching the pattern used by every other language entry (follow-up to #794)
- Speech-to-text model connection tests now transcribe a short bundled speech clip instead of silence, so a passing test returns real text instead of a blank transcription (#838)

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Embedding chunking is now token-based instead of character-based, improving chunk sizing consistency for CJK and mixed-language content (#542, #749)
- `VAULT_CHUNK_SIZE` and `VAULT_CHUNK_OVERLAP` semantics changed from characters to tokens; default reduced from 1200 characters to 400 tokens to stay safely below the 512-token ceiling of BERT-family embedders (e.g. mxbai-embed-large) after accounting for tokenizer mismatch and splitter overshoot. Existing stored embeddings are unaffected; only new ingestions use the new chunking.

### Fixed
- Credentials endpoint no longer crashes (500) when encryption key doesn't match stored credentials (#740)
- Broken credentials are now shown with a decryption warning and can still be deleted
- DELETE endpoint for broken credentials supports model migration (`migrate_to` parameter)

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-09

- 413 errors now classified with user-friendly message in error classifier
- Misleading "Created 0 embedded chunks" log in `process_source_command` — embedding is fire-and-forget, so the count was always 0; now logs "embedding submitted" instead
